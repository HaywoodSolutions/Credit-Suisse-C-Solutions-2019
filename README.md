# Credit Suisse Coding Challenge 2019

I entered the Credit Suisse Coding Challenge 2019 this year after entering it last year. Initially using JavaScript then moving to C#, due to the faster computing time.

Would have been nice to have the languages computing time standardised so it more who can write the best code than who can choose the best language. 

This time I acheived:
1. **6th in the UK** out of 531 participants
2. **23rd Globally** out of 4514 participants

Also I do have the full [leaderboards](./leaderboards/Top 10s.md) and [winners](./leaderboards/Winners.md).
