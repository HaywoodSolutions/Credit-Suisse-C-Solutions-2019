Help F.A.Q.s
You haven't provided me a link with a skeleton, and my repositories are empty!
The skeletons are available at https://github.com/CS-CodingChallenge/TA-GCC-2019 and come fully equipped with README files with instructions. For further information on getting started, please consult the "In Focus: Getting Started" article in the News section.

There are missing parameters in Question 6. Where are they?
The skeletons for Question 6 are correct. Part of the challenge to the question is the need to determine what the starting and ending letters are.

How many people can enter in a team?
There is a maximum of three participants per team.

My score is stuck at zero. Why?
There are several potential reasons for this. Please check if your code compiles, and that you have copied the skeleton files from our central repository correctly. For the skeleton, your repository should only have the contents of the language folder you wish to use, and this should all be at the root directory of your repository. Please note that this must be your assigned repository - taking a fork of the skeleton is not sufficient. If you have checked both of these then please confirm that you have a file named ".travis.yml" (note the period before "travis") - incorrectly naming this will also cause your code to not run.

How do I submit code?
Once the challenge starts you will find four Global Coding Challenge repositories in your GitHub account - one for each of the Challenge languages. You'll be provided a link in your email to a central repository from which you can copy our code skeletons to your repositories. You can use these skeletons to build solutions to the questions found on the Questions tab. Once you push your code, it will be reflected on the leaderboard for your region.

Why has my score not updated on the leaderboards after pushing my code?
The leaderboards update once every ten minutes so your score may not reflect immediately after code submission.

How is the University Score calculated?
You automatically represent your University. The top 20 highest scorers from a university will have their scores combined to create that University's score. This is then displayed on the University Leaderboard for that region

Why are there so many leaderboards?
There are six regions competing simultaneously and each region has its own Individual Leaderboard and University Leaderboard. There are also three Global Leaderboards. An Individual Global Leaderboard which is formed using the top 20 competitors from each region, a Global University Leaderboard which displays the top five Universities from each region and one Referral Leaderboard, which displays all students who have referred a friend.

My score keeps fluctuating
This is expected. Your test results are compared against other contestants each time the leaderboard is calculated. So when another student submits new code, you may find that your score goes up or down, depending on how good your answers are when compared to the new entrant.

Who can enter the competition?
The competition is for current and former TAs who joined Credit Suisse in 2015 or later. There will be a short verification process before prizes are awarded.
