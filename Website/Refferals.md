# Global Referral Winner
The TA who is at the top of our referral leaderboard at the end of the competition will win be deemed the Global Referral Winner.

Your referral score is calculated by combining the scores of all the colleagues that you have nominated, and multiplying this by a factor which increases per referral.

To refer a candidate click the Refer a Friend tab. The referral leaderboard will also be available here once the Challenge has begun.
