Welcome to the Credit Suisse Global Coding Challenge

GitHub Repositories
Shortly after signing up, you'll be granted access to your personal git repositories. Please ensure that you monitor your emails for the invites from GitHub. You'll recieve four invites - one repository for each language. Please note that you can submit code in as many of the four languages as you want, but only the most recently submitted will be counted on the leaderboard.

Getting started
Now that you have your repositories, it's time to get started. Here you can find skeletons for the languages offered in the challenge:
If you signed up to the Challenge before noon UTC on Friday October 11th 2019, then you can follow the instructions found in the README.md file in the folder of your chosen language.
If you signed up to the Challenge after noon UTC on Friday October 11th 2019, then to begin you should copy and paste the contents of your favoured language's folder into your personal repository.

Submitting answers
To answer the questions (which can be found on the questions tab of the Coding Challenge website), simply fill in your answer in the skeleton files provided. Once you are satisfied with your solution, you can submit by using the "git push" command. Please allow some time to see your score reflected on the leaderboard - this could be approximately 30 minutes at peak times. You can also run the test suite locally, but please note that this will not add your score to the leaderboard. You can submit your solutions to the leaderboard as many times as you'd like.

What not to do
In each skeleton provided by the Global Coding Challenge team, there are some files that should not be edited, unless with the express written permission of the GCC team. These files are listed in the README.md for each language. Potential penalties for editing these files include the suspension of your scores on the leaderboard, and disqualification. The GCC team reserve the right to change the list of files that can't be edited, as and when necessary.

Good Luck in the Global Coding Challenge!
