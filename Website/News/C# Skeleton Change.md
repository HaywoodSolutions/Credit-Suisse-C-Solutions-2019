We have made some changes to the skeletons available, changes of which are detailed below

C# Skeleton
Minor changes have been made to the testing files for the C# skeleton, which address some issues that contestants were having. The updated skeleton can be found here. It is recommended that contestants using C# copy and paste the entire folder contents into their repositories, so as to ensure all changes are included.

In the C# Skeleton, the following files should not be edited without prior written consent:

C_Sharp_Skeleton_2019.Tests/SkeletonTests.cs
.travis.yml
Java Skeleton
One change has been made to the Java skeleton. In the Q3Object.java file in the tests directory, please change line 21 (this.alice = this.alice;) to "this.alice = alice;"

We thank the eagle-eyed contestants who spotted that this change needed to be made.

Question 3
We are aware that some contestants have had issues with the test cases in Question 3. Please know that these issues have now been addressed. To see your new score for question 3, please push your repositories again.

Good luck with the remainder of the GCC!
