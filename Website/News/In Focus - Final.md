We hope that you have enjoyed taking part in the Global Coding Challenge. Below we set out the steps that will take place once the challenge has completed
The Global Coding Challenge ends on Wednesday 23rd October at 1pm GMT. This is:

United States of America: 9am EDT
United Kingdom and Ireland: 2pm
Switzerland: 3pm
Poland: 3pm
India: 6:30pm
After this time, no changes will be accepted by the test runners, so please ensure that if you are planning to submit further changes that you do so with time to spare before the deadline. We anticipate that there could be a build queue in some regions, so please afford yourself additional time for those final changes. Do bear in mind though that you can’t make any changes, so if your score goes down because of your final change there’s no opportunity to go back to an older version.

After the deadline passes, the leaderboards will be temporarily locked. A verification process will take place of the leading candidates’ GitHub repositories. This verification check is to ensure that no candidate has gained an unfair advantage, either through the editing of files that are not meant to be edited (except with our explicit written permission, or as part of a patch), or by trying to “game the system” in any way. For clarity, the files that can’t be edited are as follows:

Python – vcc_skeleton.py, .travis.yml
Java – src/test/*, .travis.yml
Javascript – spec.js, .travis.yml
C# - SkeletonTests.cs, .travis.yml
Please note that potential penalties for a breach of the above rules during the verification process include disqualification. A rudimentary check will also take place to confirm that the code present in your GitHub repository tallies with the number of tests you have passed on the automated test runners, and that you meet the competition's eligibility requirements.

Once this verification has been completed, the leaderboards will be run one final time, and the winners decided. We will make this announcement via email, so keep your eyes peeled over the 48 hours following the competition.

Good Luck to all!
