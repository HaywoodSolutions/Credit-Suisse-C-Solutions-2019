The key to solving this question efficiently is identifying that the stock with the highest value to be returned from the portfolio, is the stock with the highest index value from the portfolio array, and that we need a structure to store the data to make the comparison efficient.

If we take a look at another example:

Array portfolio S: {AXAXPE, VYAEQM, AQEPE, AXFDPE, DVGDV}

We first need to find the most common start and ending substrings in the array of words. In this case the starting and ending which will be run for this test case are AX and PE

In order to solve this we identify that we need a mechanism of efficiently comparing each letter of the stocks in the portfolio, to see if they have the required starting, in this case AX. From the portfolio above, for each stock we compare the stock name with the prefix, in this case AX. If the first letter is A, then we proceed to compare the second letter, in this case the stocks at index 1 and index 4 wold not pass the first comparison. For the stocks at index 0, 2 and 3, we will now compare the second letter, if it is X, then we now proceed to considering the suffix, which is PE.

Both AXAXPE and AXFDPE have the required starting and ending, therefore we now compare their values, the value of AXAXPE is 0, and AXFDPE is 3, therefore we return 3, as it is the index of the stock with the highest value.
