In the second of our In Focus series, we'll take a closer look at the example for Question 1.

The crux to question 1 is to try and identify the number of repayments needed to be made, and then simply add that to the deposit and final repayment to get a final total.
If we take a look at the example given for Question 1, we have the following parameters:

Initial Level of Debt = 1000
Interest Percentage = 5%
Repayment Percentage = 10%
Since we know that the repayment is fixed, we can calculate this already to be 100 per month. The interest needs tobe calculated each month, and we can see that the initial interest will be 50. Adding 50 to 1000 gets us to 1050, and the first repayment is then completed, bringing us to a total debt remaining of 950, with one payment of 100 made.

Following this through, we then identify the following payments for the next couple of months


Debt	After Interest	After Repayment	Total Paid this month
950	997.50	897.50	100
897.50	942.38	842.38	100

Eventually, after 14 payments, we reach a debt of 20 after interest. This means that the final repayment is 20. Add this to our 14 repayments of 100 each, and our initial deposit of 100 (10% of 1000), and we reach a final rounded payment of 1520 (Please note that this is a correction from the original value we stated of 1540).
