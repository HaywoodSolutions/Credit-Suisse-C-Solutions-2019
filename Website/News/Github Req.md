Welcome to the Global Coding Challenge. The following is a step-by-step guide on how to checkout, push to GitHub and put yourself on the leaderboard.

Pre-Requisites
Make sure you have Git installed on your computer - you can download and install it here.

How to copy your repository
Create a folder on your desktop called CodingChallenge2019.
Open up Command Line on Windows or Terminal on Mac OS X
In Command Line/Terminal Navigate to the CodingChallenge2019 folder on your Desktop by typing in – $ cd Desktop/CodingChallenge2019
Once you’re in the folder clone your GitHub repository by executing the following command – $ git clone [insert link of your GitHub Repository here, without the brackets]
You should now have the repository checked out locally.
Now go to the skeleton folders, found here, and copy the contents of the language of your choice to your git repository.
Using the IDE (e.g. IntelliJ/Eclipse) of your choice, open up your local repository and make changes to the answer files provided in the previous step.
How to commit and push your changes to GitHub for it to be evaluated:
Open up Command Line/Terminal and navigate to your repository by executing this command – $ cd Desktop/CodingChallenge2019/[Your Repository without the brackets]
Check all the files that you have changed - $ git status
Marks the files that you have changed ready to be committed and pushed - $ git add . (The ‘.’ represents to add everything you have changed)
Commit your files to your GitHub Repository $ git commit –m “[Insert Commit Message here, without the brackets]”
Push your changes to the master branch - $ git push
Good luck in the Global Coding Challenge!
