Javascript Skeleton
Minor changes have been made to the testing files for the Javascript skeleton, which address some issues that contestants were having with gaining a score for question 1. These have been addressed with optimisations made to the test runner.

The updated file can be found here. It is recommended that contestants using Javascript copy and paste the entire file into their repositories, so as to ensure all changes are included.

All contestants using Javascript must apply this update.
