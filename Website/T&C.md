# The Credit Suisse Global Coding Challenge

# OBJECTIVE
Credit Suisse International (“Credit Suisse”) wishes to encourage Undergraduate and Masters Students from around the world to consider careers within the Credit Suisse Technology (IT) team. Credit Suisse is proud to introduce The Credit Suisse Global Coding Challenge (“The Coding Challenge”), a coding challenge whereby the winning individual will be awarded with an Apple MacBook Pro or a prize with at least an equivalent value. Winners of each region will win an Apple iPhone 11 Pro for first prize, second place will receive a Nintendo Switch or equivalent. Third place will receive a Jabra Elite 65t Wireless Earbuds or equivalent.

# ELIGIBILITY
To be eligible to enter into The Coding Challenge, participants must currently be registered as an Undergraduate or Masters student and studying an Undergraduate or Masters degree or equivalent. Participants must apply and participate on an individual basis. Immediate family members of employees at Credit Suisse and its subsidiaries and affiliates are excluded from participating. Multiple applications by the same person for The Coding Challenge shall result in disqualification.

# CONDUCT OF THE CODING CHALLENGE
The Coding Challenge will consist of an application stage and a competition stage. To apply for The Coding Challenge, each participant is required to submit a form entering some basic details about themselves and their degree. Following this, applications will be reviewed and individuals will be selected and invited to participate in a virtual coding challenge (“The Coding Challenge”) over a period of 2 weeks (subject to change) whereby participants will develop and code solutions (each a “Solution”) and submit such Solutions to designated code repositories. The Solutions will be compared by an automatic evaluator that tests each repository, using metrics such as accuracy and efficiency to distinguish the best Solutions, published on an online leader board. Metrics and how they correspond to scores will be provided in an instruction pack when
the competition begins.

# (i) Application:

To enter into The Coding Challenge, each participant is required to complete a form at http://creditsuisse.com/codingchallenge. Each participant must submit an application (“Application”). The closing date for Applications is 14:00 BST, 23rd October 2019. Individuals will then be selected and invited to participate in The Coding Challenge on a rolling basis. They will receive instructions on their next steps and how to participate.

# (ii) Coding Challenge:
The nature and specifics of The Coding Challenge are at the sole and absolute discretion of Credit Suisse and are subject to change at any time. The format will be a series of questions designed to test coding ability, with the formats of the inputs and the outputs clearly stated in the instructions. Solutions should be written in Python, Java, JavaScript or C# and submitted to repositories strictly in accordance with the instructions provided. Solutions will be then timed and the outputs analysed in order to ascertain a winner. Scoring will be done by an Automatic Evaluator that tests the code submitted and analyses responses, based on metrics including accuracy and efficiency. Scoring will then be computed automatically – details on this will be provided in the instructions. In the case of a draw, Credit Suisse will have the final say, based on the quality of the Solutions submitted. Failure to follow any of the instructions sent to participants may result in disqualification.
 
Participants must follow each step in the instruction pack as to how to undertake the challenge. Failure to follow this clause may lead to disqualification of the participants. Credit Suisse retains the right to alter these rules at any time, at which point the participants will be notified.

# (iii) Final Evaluation:
Individuals will be required to have completed their submissions by the deadlines outlined in the joining instructions. Solutions will be evaluated regularly, in Evaluations. During the Evaluations, each contestant’s Solution will be tested with an automated evaluator developed by Credit Suisse (“Automated Evaluator”) to assess its functionality and performance. The individual with the highest number of points awarded by the Automated Evaluator across the series of questions will win the Coding Challenge. Further details on the assessment process and the awarding of points will be provided in an instruction pack at the beginning of the Coding Challenge.

Solutions with broken links or crashes will result in a penalty during the Evaluations. Credit Suisse reserves all rights to develop, make any necessary changes to and interpret any results derived from, the Automated Evaluator, and to do so in its sole and absolute discretion. Decisions made by Credit Suisse will be final and binding.

# (v) Results:
The results of The Coding Challenge will be announced on or before Wednesday, 30th October 2019. The Application, Solution and any other submissions made in relation to the Coding Challenge are herein collectively referred to as the “Submissions”.

By applying for The Coding Challenge, each individual agrees that they have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions of The Coding Challenge as set out in this document (the “Terms and Conditions”).
